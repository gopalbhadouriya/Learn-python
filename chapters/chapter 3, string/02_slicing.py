# this methord call slicing 
# solutions ---
# first we solve[1:8] 
# that is "gdhfgfsg"
# we end letter can't be count
# so that is "gdhfgfs"
# mow [1:8] has solved 
# now solve 3
# so gdhfgfs
# we count first number that is g
# we count a number which is three place 
# of this which is f
# and count next third place
# which is s 
# so output is gfs
# solved
